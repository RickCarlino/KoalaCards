2. They are shown a "Daily Writing Progress" progress bar. Under the bar, there's a "Generate New Writing Prompts" button. When they click it, the UI shows a new time.
3. The new tile begins loading the writing prompts. Three prompts are shown. They can chose to translate the prompt, or they can select the prompt. If they select the prompt, it moves them to the next tile.
4. The next tile shows the prompt above a text box. The text box has a "Save and Review Feedback" button.
5. After clicking the button, the final tile appears. It shows corrections as it does today. They can click "Explain selected words" and it will show the unknown words. That will also expose the button that allows them to generate examples on the new words in a new tab. There is also a "Write More" button that will reset everything and send them back to step 1.
