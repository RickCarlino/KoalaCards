KoalaCards is an advanced [spaced repetition system (SRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) designed to enhance language learning, with a strong focus on **listening and speaking skills**. It leverages modern technologies like speech-to-text and large language models (LLMs) for objective, human-like assessment of user responses.

Unlike traditional SRS apps that often rely on self-grading, KoalaCards provides:

1.  **Objective Grading:** Machine-assisted grading ensures consistent and unbiased evaluation of listening and speaking skills.
2.  **Flexible Assessment:** Accepts "close enough" answers that convey the correct meaning, mirroring the flexibility of human tutors while maintaining objectivity.

## Features üí°

*   **Spaced Repetition:** Utilizes the [FSRS scheduling algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki) for efficient review scheduling.
*   **Quiz Types:**
    *   **Listening Quiz:** Listen to a target language phrase and translate it into English.
    *   **Speaking Quiz:** Read an English prompt and speak the translation in the target language. Responses are transcribed and graded by an LLM (e.g., GPT). üé§
*   **Card Management:**
    *   Create cards manually, from text input, CSV files, or word lists.
    *   Bulk card creation and import capabilities.
    *   Edit and delete individual cards.
    *   Pause specific cards from review.
    *   Associate AI-generated images with cards.
*   **Deck Management:**
    *   Organize cards into decks.
    *   Create, copy, update, and delete decks.
    *   Share and report decks.
*   **AI-Powered Features:**
    *   Text-to-Speech (TTS) for listening practice. üó£Ô∏è
    *   Speech-to-Text (STT) for transcribing spoken answers.
    *   LLM-based grading for speaking quizzes.
    *   Grammar correction and explanation.
    *   Auto-define of unknown words.
    *   Generation of writing prompts for writing practice exercises.
    *   "Remix" existing cards to create variations.
*   **User Experience:**
    *   User settings customization.
    *   Review history and progress tracking.
    *   Handling of failed quizzes ("Repair" queue).
    *   Keyboard hotkeys for efficient review.
    *   Microphone permission handling.
*   **Admin & Infrastructure:**
    *   Admin panel for user management (implied).
    *   "Faucet" system (potentially for managing API credits/usage).
    *   Docker support for easy deployment.

## Developer Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Detailed setup instructions can be found in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

A Docker setup is available via `docker-compose.yml` for easier environment configuration.
